Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model and interact with data in a MongoDB database. Mongoose simplifies the task of writing queries and interacting with MongoDB by allowing you to work with objects (i.e., JavaScript objects) instead of working directly with the MongoDB query language.
**npm install mongoose**
Importing 
const mongoose = require('mongoose');



To install node-redis, simply:

npm install redis


Watchtower is an application that will monitor your running Docker containers and watch for changes to the images that those containers were originally started from. If watchtower detects that an image has changed, it will automatically restart the container using the new image.
